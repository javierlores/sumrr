Margaret Thatcher entertained former Children dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet at her home two weeks before he was arrested in his bed in a London hospital, the ex-prime minister's office said Tuesday, amid growing diplomatic and domestic controversy over the move. Pinochet, who has vowed to fight attempts to extradite him to Spain on allegations of murder, genocide and torture, had drinks with Lady Thatcher and her husband, Denis, in their home in London's elite Belgravia district four days before he was hospitalized for back surgery performed Oct. 9. ``She regarded it as a private meeting,'' said Mark Worthington, spokesman for the Lady Thatcher, Conservative Party prime minister from 1979-90.
