The attack took place Tuesday near Cailaco in East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, according to a statement issued by the pro-independence Christian Democratic Union of East Timor. After Portugal abandoned its former colony in East Timor in 1975, Indonesia invaded it and annexed it the following year. The United Nations refuses to recognize the annexation as legitimate; Australia is one of the few nations that recognizes Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor.  Representatives of exiled East Timorese pro-independence groups said Friday that Indonesian troops attacked unarmed civilians in a village in the disputed Southeast Asian territory, killing one East Timorese and wounding 22 others.
