Though government officials say such a plan is only one of six possibilities, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov warned Thursday that he might be forced to take ``unpopular'' measures to rescue the Russian economy if it does not receive the next installment in a dlrs 22.6 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund. But Primakov said that the country's plan would be dependent on the IMF loan, not the other way around. The United States is disappointed by the economic confusion within the new Russian government of Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Friday, and she warned Russia about the dangers of an anti-Western policy.
