Russia's new prime minister picked an unusual way to reassure the nation Thursday. After two weeks of deliberations he announced that he still had no plan to rescue the country from its economic crisis. ``I want to repeat once more _ there is no program,'' Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said. ``It has yet to be worked out.'' In most nations such a statement might provoke alarm. But Primakov was seeking to calm an anxious public that was worried that the Kremlin's cure could be worse than the disease. It is not as if Russians do not have something to be concerned about. Thursday Primakov convened a meeting of top aides to try to hammer out a strategy for overcoming the economic woes.
