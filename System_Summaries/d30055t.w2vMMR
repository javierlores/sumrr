If the Communist Refounding's parliamentary deputies abide by the resolution, which passed by a vote of 188-112, it will destabilize Italy's government at a time when the outcome of the recent election in Germany has already injected a note of uncertainty into the future of European economic and fiscal policy. But one of the leaders of that centrist group, Clemente Mastella, said Sunday that it would not support the government generally, leaving the future of Prodi's coalition highly uncertain.  Cossiga's party came to Prodi's rescue in June, when the hard-line leftists refused to back Prodi on NATO expansion. Prodi has said he won't take the job back unless his new government could stick to the policies of its old one, an unlikely scenario given the divided Parliament.
