Struggling to meet their fourth deadline over the federal budget, congressional Republicans and White House officials wrestled Tuesday with their differences over education, staging events to demonstrate support for what has become the most public and politically high-stakes element of the budget battle. Negotiators met into the night to hash out their disagreements over aid for schools, the census and contraceptives. These were among the biggest issues that still separated the two sides as each tried to formulate a message to take home to voters for the Nov. 3 elections. On education, the issue that President Clinton has propelled to the forefront of the talks and on which Republicans do not want to appear recalcitrant, both sides have agreed to spend more than $1 billion but disagree over how to spend it.
