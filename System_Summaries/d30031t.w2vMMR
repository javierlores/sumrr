Following a series of intricate maneuvers and the skillful use of the space shuttle Endeavour's robot arm, astronauts on Sunday joined the first two of many segments that will form the international space station. She used views from remote cameras and a computerized vision system built on the arm to estimate the relative positions of the two large segments. By the time controllers traced the problem to a momentary drop in hydraulic pressure and decided to press ahead, it was too late _ they had missed the cutoff by a second or two. We do things by the book, and we're not going to cut any corners even if it means just shaving a second or two.'' But by then it was too late: time had run out for one of the procedures needed to keep the shuttle's fuel supercold.
