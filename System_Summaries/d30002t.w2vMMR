Two British ships that were in the area on an exercise were on their way to Honduras to join relief efforts, the Defense Ministry said Friday. ``It's a coincidence that the ships are there but they've got men and equipment that can be put to work in an organized way,'' said International Development Secretary Clare Short. After remaining virtually stationary for more than a day, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Thursday the center of the 350-mile-wide (560-kilometer-wide) storm had moved slightly to the south but remained just off the Honduran coast. Honduran officials said 14 people had died on that small island alone, and at least nine had died elsewhere in the country. The U.N. World Food Program said Thursday it was diverting ships, some already at sea, to rush their cargoes of donated food to Central America.
