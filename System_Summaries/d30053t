The Palestinian leader also said he hoped Clinton would exert pressure on Israel to keep its obligations under the Wye agreement. ``America supports a peace agreement that further reinforces the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian lands,'' he said.  Benjamin Netanyahu's refusal to move the peace process forward, which has frustrated President Bill Clinton and angered the Palestinians, may not be enough to save his government from collapse next week. Also Sunday, another quarrel was brewing over the scheduled meeting of the Palestinian National Council, the Palestinian parliament-in-exile, in the Gaza Strip during Clinton's visit.
