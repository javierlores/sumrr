In a green aviator jacket and black cap, President Clinton spent Sunday visiting American troops stationed in South Korea. He promoted a private, sang birthday greetings to a sergeant major and described the threats to his hopes for peaceful engagement with North Korea. ``Lately, signs of danger have intensified,'' Clinton said in an address to airmen here, standing before a gunmetal gray F-16 and A-10 parked nose-to-nose. ``So we must remain vigilant. And thanks to you, we are.'' For all his eagerness to talk about information-age economic dangers like quicksilver currency flows, Clinton has returned again and again during his five-day trip to Japan and South Korea to the old-style regional military threat posed by North Korea.
