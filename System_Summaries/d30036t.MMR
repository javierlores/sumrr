Jose Saramago became the first writer in Portuguese to win the Nobel Prize for Literature on Thursday. ``It has taken all of this century to win a Nobel Prize for the Portuguese language,'' Saramago said at the Frankfurt Book Fair, speaking through an interpreter. Jose Saramago, a 75-year-old Portuguese writer who took up literature relatively late in life and whose richly imaginative novels soon won him a following of loyal readers across Europe and vocal admirers in the United States, was awarded this year's Nobel Prize in Literature Thursday by the Swedish Academy in Stockholm. ``Nothing in my life would have led one to think I'd win the Nobel Prize'', said Saramago.
