Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met here Sunday with Syrian President Hafez Assad to try to defuse growing tension between Syria and Turkey. Mubarak left after the two-hour meeting without speaking to reporters. But Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, who accompanied him on the trip, said before their departure that Mubarak ``backs dialogue for solving disputes and not military power and threats.'' Egypt's Middle East News Agency quoted Moussa as saying that Arab support for Syria should not be read in Ankara as animosity toward Turkey. The agency also quoted Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa as saying that Egypt and Syria ``agreed on the graveness of the situation and that it should be dealt with diplomatically and not through confrontation or threats.''
