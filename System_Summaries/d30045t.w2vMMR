Oil industry analysts say that the first targets of a combined company's efforts to cut billions of dollars in annual costs would be the office staff and the professionals, like geologists and engineers, in the field. Many members, who typically came to work after high school, are already molding the oil companies' latest exploits into case studies fit for rapacious MBA's. Oil stocks led the way as investors soaked up the news of continuing talks between Exxon and Mobil on a merger that would create the world's largest oil company. Although Mobil under Noto has moved quickly to cut costs and muscle its way into promising new areas such as Kazakhstan, where it is a partner in a joint venture to develop the huge Tengiz oil field, the payoff from such ventures is many years away.
