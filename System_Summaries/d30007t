After a day of fighting, Congolese rebels said Sunday they had entered Kindu, the strategic town and airbase in eastern Congo used by the government to halt their advances. Etienne Ngangura, a rebel spokesman, said the rebel fighters were inside Kindu and had taken the adjacent, large airbase, 380 kilometers (235 miles) west of Goma, the rebel stronghold. ``We're in the town and the airport,'' Ngangura said. He offered no details and the report could not be confirmed independently. Rebel military sources said the fighting continued inside Kindu where the rebels were apparently meeting stiff resistance.
