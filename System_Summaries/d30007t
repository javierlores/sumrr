After a day of fighting, Congolese rebels said Sunday they had entered Kindu, the strategic town and airbase in eastern Congo used by the government to halt their advances. The rebels _ ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of President Laurent Kabila's army and opposition politicians _ took up arms Aug. 2 accusing Kabila of mismanagement, corruption and creating division among Congo's 400 tribes. If the rebels succeed in capturing Kindu, 380 kilometers (235 miles) west of Goma, the rebel headquarters, this will remove the last government stronghold in eastern Congo and pave the way for rebel advance into the mineral-rich southwest.
