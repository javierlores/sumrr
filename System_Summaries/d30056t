The severed heads of the four men were found lined up along a highway Tuesday outside Chechnya's capital Grozny, and hundreds of Chechen law enforcement officers were searching for the bodies Wednesday. Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said Wednesday that one alleged kidnapper had been arrested and authorities gleaned enough information to launch a rescue operation for the hostages, three Britons and a New Zealander. But during the rescue attempt the kidnappers panicked and decapitated the captives, Maskhadov said, according to Russian media reports. ``A concrete criminal group was identified, an organizer of the abductions was arrested and an approximate location of the hostages was determined,'' Maskhadov said in a statement.
