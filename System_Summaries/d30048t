There's no such thing as a free lunch any longer in Brazil, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso is telling government workers. No haircuts or phone calls, either. Eager to bolster the sagging economy, Cardoso wants to slash dlrs 19 billion from the budget deficit, and he's beginning by paring perks for the more than 2,000 workers at the presidential palace in Brasilia, the capital. Sure, it's not much when compared with a deficit of some dlrs 65 billion, or 7 percent of economic output. But as Cardoso readies a package of spending cuts and tax increases, he clearly wants to show Brazilians that economy starts at home. So goodbye to the afternoon courtesy snack of sandwiches, fruit and juice, a palace tradition.
