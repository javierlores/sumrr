``It is now clear that no party leader can form a government that can win a vote of confidence,'' former Premier Mesut Yilmaz said after talks with Demirel. Only center-right leader Tansu Ciller said she wanted a government led by a party leader, and made clear she was willing to take on the task. Turkey's parliament is split by longstanding animosity between its center-left and center-right parties. Yilmaz led the last government, which collapsed in November amid allegations he had ties to organized crime and interfered with the sale of a state bank. Turkey has been trying to form a new government since a coalition government led by Yilmaz collapsed last month over allegations that he rigged the sale of a bank.
