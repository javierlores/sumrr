President Suleyman Demirel appeared likely to turn to some widely trusted lawmaker to form Turkey's next government, after a veteran politician abandoned efforts Monday to persuade bickering political leaders to support him in a pro-secular coalition. Bulent Ecevit of the Democratic Left Party failed in a 3-week-old attempt to form a government that could command a majority of votes in Parliament. ``It is now clear that no party leader can form a government that can win a vote of confidence,'' former Premier Mesut Yilmaz said after talks with Demirel. ``We have told the president that we will not hamper the appointment of a deputy of Parliament.''
