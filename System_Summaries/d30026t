The proposed deal is a complex, three-way transaction involving AOL, Netscape and Sun Microsystems Inc. AOL, the leading on-line service with more than 14 million subscribers, would acquire Netscape's popular site on the World Wide Web and its software business. Even before the Netscape deal, America Online was moving to provide some electronic commerce software and services. This new software, which now will be combined with Netscape's online store services, will be available for companies to use both on America Online and on the Internet.
