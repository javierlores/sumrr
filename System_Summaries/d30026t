America Online is on the verge of agreeing to purchase Netscape Communications Corp., the Internet pioneer at the center of the government's antitrust suit against Microsoft Corp., executives involved in the talks said Sunday. The proposed deal is a complex, three-way transaction involving AOL, Netscape and Sun Microsystems Inc. AOL, the leading on-line service with more than 14 million subscribers, would acquire Netscape's popular site on the World Wide Web and its software business. But as part of the deal, AOL would also enter into a joint marketing and development partnership with Sun Microsystems to strengthen Netscape's other business of selling to large corporations the heavy-duty software needed to serve up Web pages and other Internet technologies to many thousands of users at the same time.
