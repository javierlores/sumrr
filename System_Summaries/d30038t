The mayor of the Japanese city of Nagano, site of the 1998 Winter Olympics, denied allegations that city officials bribed members of the International Olympic Committee to win the right to host the games. Nagano Mayor Tasuku Tsukada was responding to allegations by Marc Hodler, the Swiss member of the IOC executive board, of systematic buying and selling of the Olympic Games. ``I have never heard of such a thing,'' Tsukada told the Associated Press Sunday. ``As far as Nagano is concerned, we haven't done anything wrong. We were selected as host of the Olympics through our efforts. We can't believe that Mr. Hodler has made such a statement,'' he said.
