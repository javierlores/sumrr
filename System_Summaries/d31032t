Doctors ordered Russian President Boris Yeltsin to cut short his Central Asian trip because of a respiratory infection and he agreed to return home Monday, a day earlier than planned, officials said. Even if had passed, the move would have had no legal consequences, but it highlighted growing anti-Yeltsin sentiments in the chamber made up of powerful regional leaders, most of whom have been loyal to the president. Mikhail Mityukov, the presidential representative on the Constitutional Court, said Thursday that Yeltsin would ignore calls for an early resignation. ``The president is a strong person, and he has been through far more difficult political situations,'' Mityukov said, according to Interfax.
