In the summer of 1995, a whiff of revolution was in the air in Silicon Valley. The Internet offered a new deal in computing, a fresh opportunity for entrepreneurs to try to break Microsoft Corp.'s firm grip on the personal computer software business. Leading the challenge was Netscape Communications Corp., whose software for browsing the World Wide Web had ignited the Internet boom. Netscape chairman James Clark spoke boldly of attacking Microsoft head-on. He borrowed imagery from the movie ``Star Wars,'' referring to Microsoft as the Death Star and Netscape as the leader of a rebel alliance. Microsoft answered with a vengeance. It dispatched hundreds of programmers to work on a competing browser and poured many millions of dollars into marketing it.
