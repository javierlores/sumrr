Jose Saramago became the first writer in Portuguese to win the Nobel Prize for Literature on Thursday. Meanwhile in Portugal, where Saramago is scheduled to arrive on Tuesday, the delight at the Swedish Academy's award for Saramago was reflected in the daily papers, with even the country's three daily sports papers ample space to the event. The two leading dailies, Publico and Diario de Noticias, gave over their entire front pages to Saramago. Lisbon City Hall rushed out posters saying ``Congratulations Jose Saramago'' which were hung up around the capital during the night. Saramago was born into a poor, illiterate family in Azinhaga, a small town near Lisbon. He never finished university but continued to study part-time while supporting himself as a metalworker.
