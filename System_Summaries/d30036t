There's room for a few more names on a 20th century honor roll of writers, and one will be added this week when the Swedish Academy announces the latest Nobel Literature laureate. Who is chosen and why stimulates animated conversation with readers as well as academics, critics and the authors themselves. This year's winner _ or, possibly, winners _ will be announced Thursday, the Academy disclosed Tuesday. ``The joke you hear is that it goes to people you never heard of,'' said Ian Jack, editor of London-based Granta literary magazine. But the Nobel, awarded most every year since 1901, also shines a light, usually deservedly, on wonderful writers few people have read, he added.
