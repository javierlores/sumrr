Last Saturday morning, while Matthew Shepard lay comatose from a beating, a college homecoming parade passed a few blocks from his hospital bed in Fort Collins. Propped on a fraternity float was a straw-haired scarecrow, labeled in black spray paint: ``I'm Gay.'' Few people missed the message. Three days earlier, Shepard, a gay University of Wyoming freshman, was savagely beaten and tied to a ranch fence in such a position that a passerby first mistook him for a scarecrow. Tuesday, officials at Colorado State University reacted with outrage to the fraternity float, opening an investigation and disciplinary procedures against the fraternity, Pi Kappa Alpha.
