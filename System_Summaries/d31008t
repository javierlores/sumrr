Matthew Shepard, the gay college student who was kidnapped and severely beaten, died here Monday, five days after he was found unconscious on a Wyoming ranch where he had been left tied to a fence for 18 hours in near-freezing temperatures. ``Sometimes I wonder why I found him alive, if he was going to die,'' Kreifels reflected, before traveling to spend this weekend at home with his parents in Grand Island, Neb. ``But I guess God wanted his parents to be with him.'' Police said Henderson and McKinney lured Shepard from the bar by saying they too were gay and one of their girlfriends said Shepard had embarassed one of the men by making a pass at him.
