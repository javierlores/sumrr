Exxon was then known as Standard Oil of New Jersey, and Mobil consisted of two companies: Standard Oil of New York and Vacuum Oil. The reported talks between Exxon, whose annual revenue exceeds that of Wal-Mart and General Electric, and Mobil, the No. 2 U.S. oil company, come as oil prices have sunk to their lowest in almost 12 years. A combined company would be bigger than Royal Dutch/Shell Group, the world's largest oil company by revenue. Financial terms of the discussions could not be determined Wednesday. Neither Exxon or Mobil would comment. Any union would reunite two parts of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust, which was broken up by the Supreme Court in 1911.
