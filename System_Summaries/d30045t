Whether or not the talks between Exxon and Mobil lead to a merger or some other business combination, America's economic history is already being rewritten. In energy as in businesses like financial services, telecommunications and automobiles, global competition and technology have made unthinkable combinations practical, even necessary. Oil companies like Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. have an additional pressure, one unthinkable less than two decades ago. Crude oil prices have fallen sharply, plunging 40 percent just this year to levels, adjusted for inflation, not seen since before the first oil embargo 25 years ago. As such, the oil companies, having spent years cutting their costs, are desperate for further savings in order to continue operating profitably with such low prices.
