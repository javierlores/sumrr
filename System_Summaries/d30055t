Premier Romano Prodi battled Tuesday for any votes freed up from a split in a far-left party, but said he will resign if he loses a confidence vote expected later this week. ``We must respect the will of the voters. If we win the confidence vote, we will go ahead, otherwise we will pass the baton,'' Prodi told a news conference closing a two-day French-Italian summit in Florence. Prodi's center-left government, Italy's second-longest since World War II, was threatened with collapse by the defection of its Communist ally. The premier will address Parliament Wednesday, followed perhaps by Friday by the vote of confidence that will determine whether the 2 1/2-year-old, center-left alliance stands or falls.
