Hundreds of people gathered Saturday to mourn the shooting death of one of Russia's most prominent women, a potential presidential candidate whose killing was widely considered to be politically motivated. President Boris Yeltsin said he would personally assume control over the investigation into the killing of Galina Starovoitova, who was gunned down Friday night as she climbed the stairs to her apartment. An aide was also shot and critically wounded. The shooting occurred in a building along St. Petersburg's atmospheric Griboedova Canal, site of another notorious Russian crime _ the murder that was the central event in Fyodor Dostoevsky's 19th century masterpiece, ``Crime and Punishment.''
