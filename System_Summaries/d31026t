Hours after Darryl Strawberry was released from Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center Friday, he spoke happily about being able to play with his two young children, joked about eating a small amount of chicken and potatoes and sounded relieved to be at home in Fort Lee, N.J., instead of in a hospital. ``I'm really feeling good,'' said Strawberry, in a telephone interview. ``It's nice to be home with the kids and to just kick back. That's all that I'm going to do. This feels good.'' Strawberry, who underwent surgery to remove a cancer from his colon on Oct. 3, said he will remain in New Jersey for another 10 or 12 days before returning home to Rancho Mirage, Calif.
