The timing is potentially important because there have been mounting questions since the bombings about whether the United States adequately followed up warnings of a possible terrorist attack on American targets in Kenya. Along the way, in an almost casual fashion, the document seems to confirm two of the central charges of the federal case against bin Laden: That he had planted a terrorist cell in Nairobi and that his operatives carried out another of the crimes laid at bin Laden's door by federal authorities _ the attacks on American soldiers in Somalia in 1993 and 1994. Senior administration officials say that at the time of the cruise missile strike they had evidence of Sudan's involvement with bin Laden in a chemical weapons program, but no direct evidence linking the Shifa plant directly to that effort. The Los Angeles Times recently reported that the administration believed that it had a legal right to use deadly force against terrorist leaders.
