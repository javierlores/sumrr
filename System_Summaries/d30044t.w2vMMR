About 1,500 Kurds who spent the night outside a military hospital where Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan is believed held continued their hunger strike Monday to protest his detention. I believe (Ocalan) wanted to leave the Middle East so he could become a political figure,'' said Hikmet Tavak, managing director of the London-based Kurdish television, MED-TV. Turkey's Anatolia news agency said Oz was determined not to free his hostage until Italy agreed to Turkey's demand to send back Ocalan who is Turkey's most wanted man. ``We have repeatedly brought attention to the problems created by the blatant violation of human rights in southeast Turkey,'' government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said late Saturday.
