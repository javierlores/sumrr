Last week, Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party and Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party agreed to form a coalition that would leave Hun Sen as sole prime minister and make the prince president of the National Assembly. The prince also said that his top general, Nhek Bunchhay, would not be given back his previous position as the second-ranking general in the Cambodian military's general staff. Nhek Bunchhay's outnumbered forces in the capital put up tough but unsuccessful resistance to last year's coup.  Cambodia's two-party opposition asked the Asian Development Bank Monday to stop providing loans to the incumbent government, which it calls illegal.
