Earlier, Libyan media suggested that Gadhafi had no authority to hand over the suspects _ an indication he was giving himself room in case he decides against giving up the two men wanted by the United States and Britain. Al Thani handed Gadhafi a letter that reaffirmed Qatar's support for Libya ``in its just position toward the so-called Lockerbie case,'' the television said, referring to Libya's objections to the U.N. sanctions imposed in 1992 to press it to hand over two Libyans wanted for the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am airliner over the Scottish town of Lockerbie that left 270 people dead. It was not known where Annan will meet with Gadhafi but diplomats said Friday the meeting will likely take place in the northern coastal town of Sirte, 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of the Libyan capital of Tripoli.
