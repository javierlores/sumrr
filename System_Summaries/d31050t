Chinese courts sentenced dissidents Xu Wenli and Wang Youcai to 13 and 11 years for trying to organize an opposition political party.  Beijing police Sunday detained one of Xu's China Democracy Party colleagues, Zha Jianguo, to prevent him from attending the trial, Xu's wife said. German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, who drew China's anger recently by meeting with exiled dissident Wei Jingsheng, said China's sentencing of two dissidents Monday was unacceptable and flouted an international treaty the country recently signed. ``The reaction of Chinese authorities is totally unacceptable,'' Fischer said, calling for the dissidents' immediate release.
