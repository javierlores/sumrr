Sources close to the prime minister, whose Cabinet has been in care-taker capacity since last Tuesday's swearing in of Emile Lahoud as president, said Hariri turned down the invitation from Lahoud to select a new Cabinet. Criticism of the nomination process also came from a meeting of Catholic bishops on Wednesday. Nevertheless, the bishops welcomed the choice of Lahoud, a fellow Catholic, a statement said.  Prime Minister Rafik Hariri has declined an informal invitation from Lebanon's new president to form the next government, sparking a political crisis in this country as it rebuilds from its devastating civil war.
