The announcement of a significant phase of the discoveries by two of Monday's winners at a meeting in 1986 ``elicited an avalanche of research activities in many different laboratories around the world,'' said the Nobel committee at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, which makes the awards. The discoveries honored on Monday were made largely during the 1980s at a time when scientists knew that bacteria produced nitric oxide but did not think it was important in animals and humans. Meanwhile in Portugal, where Saramago is scheduled to arrive on Tuesday, the delight at the Swedish Academy's award for Saramago was reflected in the daily papers, with even the country's three daily sports papers ample space to the event.
