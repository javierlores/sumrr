The 240-mile-high construction job began two hours earlier with Nancy Currie's capture of Zarya (Russian for Sunrise) using the shuttle robot arm. ``We still have some contradictions, we still have combat missiles aimed at each other, but the predominant trend is the state of cooperation and doing things together,'' said Yuri Semyonov of Russia's Energia space company. The 12.4-meter (41.2-feet) Zarya, or Sunrise, was launched by a three-stage Proton booster rocket. Zarya is designed to serve as a space tugboat in the early stages of the project, providing propulsion, power and communications. Engineers finished final preparations early Friday for the liftoff of the 24-ton module.
