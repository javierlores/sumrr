There seems to be little enthusiasm for demonstrations of any sort. Only a few thousand people turned out Sunday for the fifth anniversary of the shelling of Parliament and Yeltsin's subsequent triumph over the Communists. The Communist Party and the Federation of Independent Russian Unions, a leftist organization that says it is the main sponsor of the protests, predict that 9 million Russians will participate on Wednesday.
