The two station pieces are so big _ 77 feet from the tip of one to the tip of the other with a combined mass of 70,000 pounds _ that Currie and her crewmates had to rely on a computerized vision system and camera views, rather than direct line of sight. The only other problem was with a Zarya battery; the astronauts took up a replacement part. The antennas must be fully deployed in order for Zarya's manual docking system to work; that system won't be needed before next summer, officials said. Mission Control ordered the pilots to fire the shuttle thrusters to put an extra three miles between Endeavour and the space junk, putting Endeavour a total of five miles from the orbiting debris.
