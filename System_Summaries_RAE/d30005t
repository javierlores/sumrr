They cite Afghan tradition, which demands the host guarantee his guest protection. Administration officials have denied since August that the raid was intended to kill bin Laden, a Saudi exile who has been charged by federal prosecutors with leading a global war against U.S. interests. He has been linked to the Aug. 7 bombing of two U.S. embassies in East Africa. But a less subtle explanation was offered on Oct. 13 by Defense Secretary William Cohen, who said during a visit to Saudi Arabia that the United States had been ``going after'' bin Laden and his colleagues. ``We weren't quite successful,'' Cohen continued, ``but we sent a message.'' Kenneth Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman, said the secretary had not retracted his statements.
