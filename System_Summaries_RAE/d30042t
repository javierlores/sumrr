Libya has asked that any prison terms be served in the Netherlands or Libya. Annan left Jerba on Sunday for the United Arab Emirates, where he will attend a summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council, a federation of six Arab Gulf states. In Washington, James Foley, a State Department spokesman, said the United States is awaiting a briefing from Annan but is ``disappointed'' that Libya has not complied with U.N. Security Council resolutions. ``Compliance means turnover of the two suspects for trial,'' Foley said. ``It's been almost 10 years since the Pan Am 103 tragedy, this has gone on for far too long.''
