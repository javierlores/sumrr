The decree was to be issued after the president polled members of the 128-seat Parliament on their choice for prime minister. Among those who were absent was Walid Jumblatt, a Cabinet minister who had said he would boycott the session to protest the choice of a military man even though Lahoud has wide public and political support. The 128-member legislature is expected to meet Thursday to elect Lahoud after outgoing President Elias Hrawi signs the constitutional amendment. The amendment to Article 49 of the constitution revokes a ban on senior civil servants from running for the presidency. The new president will be sworn in Nov. 24, the day Hrawi leaves office.
