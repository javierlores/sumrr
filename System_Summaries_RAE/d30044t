``We are not terrorists, as we are considered by the Turkish state and its friends,'' said Aihan Dogan, a Kurdish leader. They included Pakistanis, Indians, Yugoslavs and Chinese as well as Kurds, the Austrians said. The border crackdown appeared designed to prevent large numbers of Kurds living in Western Europe from flocking to Rome for protests in connection with Ocalan's arrest. Turkey has asked for Ocalan's extradition. Austrian authorities said many of those turned back had come from Germany. They spoke of ``fundamental problems'' in the Cyprus negotiating process, adding ``a political solution is urgently required.''
