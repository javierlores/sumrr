In a separate attempt to block his extradition, lawyers for the former strongman went to court Friday to argue that British police acted illegally in accepting the Spanish warrant. According to the report Pinochet was informed of the arrest order from two policemen, but is convinced it was a mistake and that he is protected by diplomatic immunity. Meanwhile, a Chilean television station reported Friday that a Chilean army officer close to Pinochet told the former military chief about his situation after flying to London Thursday. TV13 reported that the unidentified officer said Pinochet reacted calmly to the news imparted ``as one soldier to another.''
