``We will take all necessary steps to solve this horrible crime,'' said Maskhadov, who has been unable to restore law and order in Chechnya since being elected last year. The severed heads of the four men were found lined up along a highway Tuesday outside Chechnya's capital Grozny, and hundreds of Chechen law enforcement officers were searching for the bodies Wednesday. Their heads were found Tuesday on a highway about 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of Grozny. Maskhadov said the deaths of the four men were a major blow to Chechnya and its efforts to gain international recognition of its independence. He blamed the rash of abductions in Chechnya to unidentified ``outside forces'' and their Chechen henchmen.
