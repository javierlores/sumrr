The issue was controversial earlier this year when Yeltsin refused to spell out his intentions and his aides insisted he had the legal right to seek re-election. Communists and other Yeltsin opponents in parliament's lower house, the State Duma, disagreed and appealed to the Constitutional Court in February. While the case has been waiting to be heard, events have overtaken it. Yeltsin has flatly said he will not seek another term, and the opposition has concentrated its efforts on demanding an early resignation, riding a wave of popular discontent over the economic crisis. The call for Yeltsin to step down was backed by many participants in a nationwide labor action earlier this month that attracted about 1 million people.
