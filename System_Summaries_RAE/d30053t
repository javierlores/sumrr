The scene at the Erekat home, in the Arab village of Abu Dis on Jerusalem's eastern outskirts, drives home a central truth about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: on both sides of the divide, the political is also deeply personal. Both sides _ to Palestinians' satisfaction, and Israel's dismay _ came to see the visit as an implicit acknowledgement of Palestinian statehood aspirations, despite increasingly desperate American efforts to avoid casting it in that light. Clinton's foray to the Gaza Strip, which is already under Palestinian rule, will be the first by a sitting American president. Palestinians intend to play on that symbolism for all it is worth, greeting him with the strains of their once-banned national anthem.
