``But if we are to believe even a small percentage of the totals which Goran Jelisic claimed, then his victims certainly number well over 100.'' The Hague's prosecutors could also draw on the observations of diplomats, human rights monitors and reporters who saw the bodies scattered in the ravine where the victims were killed before they were buried in shallow graves in the clan's nearby compound. In other Kosovo massacres, bodies had been moved from the sites before they were seen by independent observers. Further, family members who survived the assault have described what they saw and the circumstances in the hills and valleys around Obrinje as the Serbs pushed forward early Saturday morning, Sept. 26, from their headquarters at Likovac, north of here.
